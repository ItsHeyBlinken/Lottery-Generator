# Project Brief

## Overview
A personal-use desktop application that analyzes historical PowerBall drawing data and generates suggested number combinations using frequency-based logic and simple selection rules.

## Purpose
- Entertainment and learning purposes only
- Does not claim to improve lottery odds

## Core Functionality
1. Load historical PowerBall data from a .txt file
2. Perform frequency analysis on white balls (1-69) and PowerBall (1-26)
3. Generate number selections using weighted randomness
4. Display results in a desktop UI

## Technology Stack
- Electron (Node.js + HTML/CSS/JS)
- Vanilla JavaScript for business logic
- Single-window desktop application

## Key Constraints
- Single developer project
- Focus on correctness, clarity, and finishability
- No persistence beyond current session
- Always-visible disclaimer about lottery randomness
